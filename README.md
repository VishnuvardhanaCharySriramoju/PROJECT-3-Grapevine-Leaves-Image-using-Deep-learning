# PROJECT-4-Grapevine-Leaves-Image-using-Deep-learning
This comprehensive dataset, released by esteemed researchers from several Turkish universities, offers a profound exploration into the world of grapevine leaves. Consisting of 2,500 images, it captures the unique characteristics of five different grapevine species, with each species represented by 500 distinct leaf images. These images were initially taken using a specialized self-illuminating system, followed by an application of data augmentation techniques to enrich the dataset. This ensures a robust and comprehensive data collection, capable of supporting the development and validation of high-performance deep learning models. In essence, this dataset provides an invaluable resource for anyone venturing into the domain of agriculture-based AI solutions, specifically those keen on harnessing the power of deep learning and computer vision to solve real-world challenges
